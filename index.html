            <h2>What is GenBenchSite ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>
                GenBenchSite is a platform designed to <b>compare the performance of different libraries and frameworks</b>. It
                provides a detailed report of each library's speed, precision, and other parameters, making it easier for
                developers to choose the best library for their project.

            <h2>Why Creating this tool</h2>
            <p>GenBenchSite was initiated to address the need for a reliable and unbiased way of <b>
                comparing the
                    performance of different libraries
            </b>. With so many options available in the market, it can be challenging to
                choose the right library for a particular task. This tool aims to simplify the selection process by providing a
                standardized benchmarking methodology for all libraries.

            <p>
                GenBenchSite is designed to automate the process of comparing and testing different libraries. To
                achieve this, the test are written in configuration files, then given to GenBenchSite. The tests are executed in a
                controlled environment, and the results are then analyzed and compiled into easy-to-read reports. These reports
                are output as HTML files structured and then published on dedicated GitHub pages, where users can access them and see how the different libraries perform
                in a variety of scenarios. By automating the testing process, the website enables developers to save time and
                effort when evaluating libraries, and helps them make informed decisions.

            <h3>Tutorial</h3>
            <h2>First steps üë£</h2>
            <p>
                First of all, you'll need to get the project on your computer. To do so, you can either download the project
                directly from GitHub, clone it using the following command:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    git clone https://github.com/White-On/BenchSite
                </code>
                <br><br>
                or download it using the pip command:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    pip install genbenchsite
                </code>
                <br><br>

                Once you have the project on your computer, you can start creating your own benchmark. To do so, you'll need to
                create a new directory with a specific structure. The directory should contain 3 subdirectories: <b>targets</b>,
                <b>themes</b>, and <b>site</b>. The <b>targets</b> directory contains the configuration files for the libraries
                you want to test. The <b>themes</b> directory contains the configuration files for the tests you want to run. The
                <b>site</b> directory contains the configuration files for the website. 
            </p>

                </details>
            <p>
                If you are confused about the structure of the directory, you can use the following command to create a
                directory with the correct structure:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    gbs init [name of your benchmark]
                </code>
                <br><br>
                Or refer to the <a href="https://github.com/White-On/BenchMark_Matrix_Computation/tree/main">Matrix Computation
                    Benchmark</a> for an example of a benchmark.

            <h2>Setup and Launch üöÄ</h2>
            <p>With the different libraries you are going to experiment on, we recommend to use a virtual environment 
                as it will allow you to install the libraries you need without affecting your global python installation.

            <h2>How we compare the targets ü§î</h2>
            <p>
                For the time being, we decided to compare results base on the <b>Lexicographic Maximal Ordering Algorithm (LexMax)</b>.
                Each ranking is based on the number of wins, ties, and losses of each library. The target with the highest
                number of wins is ranked first, followed by the library with the second-highest number of wins, and so on. In
                the case of a tie, both libraries are ranked equally. The algorithm does not take into account the magnitude of the wins or losses, only the number of them.<br><br>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card left dotted">
        <div class="card-text">
            <p>
                We use it to compare all the data generated by the benchmarking process. For example, we run a task on a set of
                libraries, and we get the results. Each result is compared to the other result with the same argument, and we get a
                score for each argument. On the entire task, we get a vector of score for each library. We use the LexMax
                algorithm to compare the vector of score for each library and we get a ranking of the libraries for that task.
                We do this for each task and repeat it for the theme and the global ranking.
